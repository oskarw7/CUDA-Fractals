# Fractal Generator

A high-performance fractal generator built with Python that uses CUDA acceleration to create stunning Mandelbrot and Julia set visualizations.

## Features

- **CUDA-Accelerated**: Leverages GPU computing for fast fractal generation
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface built with PySide6
- **Multiple Fractals**: Support for both Mandelbrot and Julia sets
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust resolution, window placement, iterations, and Julia set constants
- **Image Export**: Save generated fractals as PNG files
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CUDA-compatible GPU
- CUDA Toolkit installed

## Installation and build

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/oskarw7/Fractal-Generator>
cd fractal-generator
```

2. Ensure you have required software and drivers installed (see `Requirements`).

3. Build app:
**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy/build_linux_macos.sh
./deploy/build_linux_macos.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\deploy\build_windows.ps1
```

4. The executable will be created in the `app/` directory as `fractal_generator`. From then it can be moved anywhere as well as added to PATH.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Using builded app:
```bash
./fractal_generator
```
 
2. Explicit call with python:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### GUI Controls

- **Min/Max X/Y**: Define the complex plane viewing area
- **Width/Height**: Set output image resolution (max 8000x8000)
- **Iterations**: Higher values = more detail but slower generation
- **Fractal Type**: Switch between Mandelbrot and Julia sets via the menu
- **Julia Parameters**: For Julia sets, adjust Re(c) and Im(c) values

## Examples

**Mandelbrot Set**: Classic fractal showing the boundary of complex numbers that remain bounded under iteration.

**Julia Set**: Fractal generated by iterating a function with a fixed complex parameter.

## Performance Notes

- Uses optimized CUDA kernels with configurable block dimensions
- Supports high-resolution rendering (tested up to 7680x5120)
- Generation time depends on resolution, iterations, and GPU capabilities
